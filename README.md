# ESP32-HUB

ESP32-HUB is a lightweight, asynchronous "Operating System" running on the ESP32 microcontroller. It functions as both a standalone development environment and a fully capable web server. Users can write and execute Python code wirelessly while simultaneously hosting custom websites directly from the chip, eliminating the need for external tools or cloud hosting for simple IoT dashboards.
